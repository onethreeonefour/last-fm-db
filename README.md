## Music DB React Application

# Overview

This is a personal project to pursure a full fledge working application without using a tutorial (and there isn't!). It took about 4-5 days of 5-6 hours of work everyday of work to finish this.

# Features

- LastFM Charts

- Top tracks & trending artists

- Search function by artist name

- Discover genres by tags

- Hi-Res photos dynamically fetched (if available)

- Mobile Responsiveness

# Technologies
- LastFM Api

- MusicBrainz Api

- Fanart-tv Api

- Material CSS (Only used for Card and Chip)

- React-multi-carousel

- Custom CSS 

LastFM no longer provides artist photos so I had to use it's MusicBrainz id provided by LastFM to pull from the fanart-tv but some artists are missing MusicBrainz id so I have to manually search (it's fairly accurate from testing)

Due to using fanart-tv free api to fetch images it's rather slow but the image quality is extremely good.
